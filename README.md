## [Linear Regression Health Cost Calculator](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb)
  - Built a TensorFlow Sequential model with Dense layers to predict health insurance costs based on demographic and health factors.
  - Preprocessed data by defining inputs, encoding categorical features, and concatenating tensors.
  - Trained the model using model.fit(), optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure prediction accuracy.


## [Image Classifier](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/cat_and_dog_image_classifier.ipynb)
  - Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.
  - Preprocessed images with data augmentation, resizing, and normalization to improve model generalization.
  - Trained the model using binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 66% on the test set.
  - Implemented real-time predictions on new images, demonstrating practical deep-learning applications.


## [SMS Spam Classifier](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/sms_text_classification.ipynb)
  - Developed a TensorFlow NLP model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) / LSTMs.
  - Preprocessed text data with tokenization, padding, and embedding layers for efficient input representation.
  - Trained the model using Binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 99% on test data.
  - Deployed the model for real-time SMS classification, improving spam detection efficiency.
