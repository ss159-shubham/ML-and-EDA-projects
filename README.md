# Machine Learning and Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

## [Linear Regression Health Cost Calculator](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb)
  - Built a TensorFlow Sequential model with Dense layers to predict health insurance costs based on demographic and health factors.
  - Preprocessed data by defining inputs, encoding categorical features, and concatenating tensors.
  - Trained the model using model.fit(), optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure prediction accuracy.


## [Image Classifier](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/cat_and_dog_image_classifier.ipynb)
  - Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.
  - Preprocessed images with data augmentation, resizing, and normalization to improve model generalization.
  - Trained the model using binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 66% on the test set.
  - Implemented real-time predictions on new images, demonstrating practical deep-learning applications.


## [SMS Spam Classifier](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/machine-learning-projects/blob/main/sms_text_classification.ipynb)
  - Developed a TensorFlow NLP model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) / LSTMs.
  - Preprocessed text data with tokenization, padding, and embedding layers for efficient input representation.
  - Trained the model using Binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 99% on test data.
  - Deployed the model for real-time SMS classification, improving spam detection efficiency.

  
## [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/ML-and-EDA-projects/blob/main/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer.ipynb)
  - Built a data analysis tool to process demographic datasets and extract key insights.
  - Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory analysis to calculate metrics like age distribution, education levels, and employment rates.


## [Medical data visualizer](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/ML-and-EDA-projects/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer/medical_data_visualizer.ipynb)
  - Performed data preprocessing (feature engineering, normalization, outlier removal) on a medical dataset.
  - Created visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib (categorical plots, correlation heatmaps).
  - Engineered new features like BMI and overweight classification for better insights.
  - Applied statistical analysis to identify key health correlations.


## [Page view time series visualizer](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/ML-and-EDA-projects/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer.ipynb)
  - Cleaned and filtered time series data by removing outliers using quantiles.
  - Created a line plot to visualize daily page views over time.
  - Developed a bar chart to show monthly trends in average page views.
  - Designed box plots to analyze yearly trends and monthly seasonality.


## [Sea level predictor](https://github.com/ss159-shubham/ML-and-EDA-projects/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb) 
  - Analyzed sea level rise trends using historical data and linear regression.
  - Created scatter plots and trend lines to visualize past and projected sea level changes.
  - Developed predictive models for future sea levels using two regression approaches.
