## Linear Regression Health Cost Calculator
  - Built a TensorFlow Sequential model with Dense layers to predict health insurance costs based on demographic and health factors.
  - Preprocessed data by defining inputs, encoding categorical features, and concatenating tensors.
  - Trained the model using model.fit(), optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure prediction accuracy.
